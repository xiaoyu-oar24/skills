### brainstorming

You MUST use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior. Explores user intent, requirements and design before implementation.

### dispatching-parallel-agents

Use when facing 2+ independent tasks that can be worked on without shared state or sequential dependencies

### executing-plans

Use when you have a written implementation plan to execute in a separate session with review checkpoints

### finishing-a-development-branch

Use when implementation is complete, all tests pass, and you need to decide how to integrate the work - guides completion of development work by presenting structured options for merge, PR, or cleanup

### receiving-code-review

Use when receiving code review feedback, before implementing suggestions, especially if feedback seems unclear or technically questionable - requires technical rigor and verification, not performative agreement or blind implementation

### requesting-code-review

Use when completing tasks, implementing major features, or before merging to verify work meets requirements

### subagent-driven-development

Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session

### systematic-debugging

Use when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior, before proposing fixes

### test-driven-development

Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code

### using-git-worktrees

Use when starting feature work that needs isolation from current workspace or before executing implementation plans - ensures an isolated workspace exists via native tools or git worktree fallback

### using-superpowers

Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring skill invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions

### verification-before-completion

Use when about to claim work is complete, fixed, or passing, before committing or creating PRs - requires running verification commands and confirming output before making any success claims; evidence before assertions always

### writing-plans

Use when you have a spec or requirements for a multi-step task, before touching code

### writing-skills

Use when creating new skills, editing existing skills, or verifying skills work before deployment
